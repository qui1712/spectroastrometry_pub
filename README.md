This repository contains the accompanying code to "On the spectroastrometric detectability of nearby Solar System-like exomoons" by Q. B. van Woerkom and E. Kleisioti, submitted to A&A. This code is intended to provide the tools necessary to reproduce the results
presented therein; in principle, the code in spectroastrometry_final_exec.py is ready to be run, but it does require that the user add the atmospheric models by Phillips et al. (2020) to the repository manually. Some additional code is included that was not used to
produce the results presented in the paper, but that was used for other purposes: we choose not to remove it, but we cannot guarantee that that part of the code is without error, and so usage thereof for anything other than exploratory purposes is discouraged.
For further explanation, please contact Quirijn van Woerkom at quirijnvanwoerkom@gmail.com.
